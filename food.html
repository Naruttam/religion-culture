  <p>Northeastern India is one of the richest floras in India, where people depend on shifting cultivation systems and forest based food products for their sustainable survival. This region, which lies under eastern Himalayan ecosystem, is not only rich in plants diversity but also have a great treasure of cultural, social and linguistic variability, conserved by tribal people. The region is a treasure of indigenous knowledge systems pertaining to agriculture, food, medicine, and natural resources management. People are habituated to live and survive with the forest and Jhum cultivation culture, which ensure a range of ethnic foods rich in nutrition and compatible to culture and ethnicity of tribes1. Since time immemorial, rural women of this region have selected many wild plants and non-vegetarian foods through trial and error2. Women have conserved many local crops, ethnic vegetables and indigenous fruits used in local diet for food and nutritional security. Most of these indigenous materials are collected by women folk either from the forest areas, conserved in shifting land or indigenous</p>

<p>These ethnobotanical resources used in traditional foods are based on the location specific demand,culture, economy, ethnicity, food habit and overall needs1,4-6. Different fermented and non-fermented foods are used in various combinations with traditional vegetables to meet the food and nutritional security6. Mainly the different tribal women share these traditional foods at community level in various cultural occasions (like Etar, Solung and Aran festival in Adi tribe), which ensure the equitable food availability and balanced nutrient supply to all the members of village.</p>

<p>The traditional foods consumed by tribes of Northeastern region are intimately connected to virtually all aspects of their socio-cultural, spiritual life and health. The new generation in the same community has undergone a rapid change in their diets over the past 30 yrs due to intervention of modern crop varieties, materialistic life and current trend towards increasing use of commercial processed foods6. For tribal people, traditional food use transformation has been radical, as people have moved from a diet in which the majority of nutrients drawn from local food, to more generic diet of store-bought food, most of which are produced and processed far away from locality6,7. People have affinity for sweet-tasting things, and these sweeteners were added to many fruits, vegetables, and even cereals & pulses based flours, which are having harmful effects7. Changing cropping pattern, types of farming systems and fast foods through globalization process, accompanied by decrease in the use of traditional vegetables, fruits and fermented ethnic foods of local tribes of northeastern region has resulted in many diseases most notably, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and other ailments.</p>

 
<p>Northeastern food will have none of it. Bland, but also hot; pungent, but also aromatic; healthy, but also fatty—these antithetical adjectives can all be used to describe a meal from the Northeast, which is incomplete without a steaming platter of rice and various green vegetables. Poultry (duck, geese, chicken), beef, pork and freshwater fish provide the protein, but the most defining aspect of northeastern cuisine is the minimal use of spice. A chilli or two (enough to spark the fire), ginger, garlic, occasionally sesame and a few local herbs are all it takes to get that distinctive flavour.

<h3><i>Assamese Cuisine And Festivals</i></h3>
<img src="images/as2.jpg" width="140" height="122" alt="" ><img src="images/as1.jpg" width="140" height="122" alt="" > <img src="images/as.jpg" width="140" height="122" alt="" > 
<p>Assamese food is mainly based on rice and fish. For dessert, or for those with a sweet tooth, there is a wide range in "pithas" (cakes).</p>

<p>Authentic Assamese cuisine is bland and yet very delicious. Very little oil is used and practically no spices. All Assamese people are non-vegetarian. Chicken is taboo in orthodox families and there are some, who may not eat meat. But it’s difficult to find anyone who does not eat fish and duck’s eggs. Mustard oil is used for cooking and occasionally clarified butter or ghee. The state’s culinary tradition can be understood from the now rarely produced Bohag Bihu feast, which involved the use of 101 different types of greens. Herbs such as modhusaleng, pipoli and brahmi went into the making of the dishes either as flavouring agents or as main ingredients. But that doesn’t mean that Assamese cuisine is largely vegetarian—duck, goose and pigeon meat are very much a part of the state’s dietary vocabulary. 
 Duck and goose are cooked with ash gourd and stuffed into plantain stalk, while pigeon meat with banana flowers and lots of black pepper is a delicious concoction that will leave you sweating. Masor tenga is a popular sour fish curry, which uses heritage tomatoes as a souring agent. And while Nagas have a taste for hornet larvae, the Assamese favour red ant eggs, which inhabit mango trees and absorb their unique flavour.</p>

<h3><i>Arunachali cuisine</h3></i>

<p>Traditional north-east delicacies, Chinese food and local food are available here. Poeple here generally take non-vegetarian diets. Most of their cuisines include famous non-vegetarian meals. Apong (local drinks made from rice or millet) is also a famous tribal delicacy of the people here.</p>

<p>Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a border with China, is the use of local herbs with strong medicinal value. Pork, poultry and mithun are all consumed in sizeable quantities. And rice (of which some varieties are indigenous to this region) is steamed, baked and shallow-fried to accompany curries and provide texture to dishes. Wungwut ngam, for instance, is a chicken speciality in which powdered rice is used to create a delicate dish. In mylliem, native peppers are used to give chicken a distinct kick.</p>

<h3><i>Manipuri Cuisin</h3></i>
<p>The traditional Manipuri fine dining was a literally 'sit-down' affair with banana-leaf plates. Their love for rice can be seen in every household here. Some take rice with meat, and some others prefer a fish delicacy along with the main dish. In fact Kabok, a traditional speciality, is mostly fried rice with a world of vegetables added in. The Iromba, an eclectic combination of fish, vegetables and bamboo shoots is served fermented.</p>

<p>
A typical Manipuri thali can have as many as 30 items, served on a plate and in bowls fashioned out of banana leaves. Dishes consist of various salads, such as singju (made of unripe papaya, chickpeas and fermented fish), various kinds of dals and rice. Typical curries include ooti, made of bamboo shoot, yellow peas and chives, hawai-uri thongba, a bean stew and bawngsha, a beef curry</p>

<h3><i>Meghalayan Food</h3></i>
<p>The Meghalayan cuisine is heavily tilted in favour of meat, particularly pork. Jadoh - a spicy dish of rice and pork is eaten almost any time. Besides, the famous local pork delicacies cooked Khasi-style, Shillong is also the Mecca of authentic Chinese food. Kyat, the local brew made from rice, adds zing to all the local celebrations. You can taste it at any of the bars spread all over Shillong Meghalaya.</p>

<p>But they also cook fish in some mouth-watering ways. They dry it, cook it in a hollow bamboo container or bake it in banana leaves over an open fire, processes that infuse the fish with delicate, smoky flavours. The Garos, who inhabit the western part of the state, use dried fish in a spicy soup called nakham bitchi, a hugely popular dish that is considered a classic example of the state’s food. Seasoning and animal fat are used sparingly in the cuisine of Meghalaya. Even today, much of what the tribes consume is based on ingredients that grow in the hills. For instance, during the monsoon, mushrooms sprout all across the Khasi and Jaintia hills and, therefore, find their way into many a dish.</P>

<h3></i>Mizoram Cuisine</h3></i>
<p>The people of Mizoram are basically non-vegetarian and love meat. The food is not spicy and is cooked in such a way that the nutritive value is actually retained. The locally made wine is a great tribal favourite . "Zu" (tea) is a popular drink. Both men and women are fond of smoking. Due to the remoteness of its location between Bangladesh and Burma, foraging for and cooking with jungle produce—leaves, roots, nuts and mushrooms—has given this state a unique culinary identity. In addition, many people grow edible plants in small kitchen gardens, giving the farm-to-table phenomenon a whole new meaning. Spices such as cardamom, clove, pepper and cinnamon are almost non-existent in Mizo cooking. Instead, leaves and roots provide the food with its characteristic flavouring.</p>

<p>Sa-um (fermented pork fat) is a frequent addition to vegetable dishes. Mizo people dry and smoke their meats (pork, chicken, mithun) and vegetable produce (bamboo shoot, yam leaves) to ensure their availability regardless of season.</p>

<h3><i>Sikkimese Food</h3></i>
<p>Sikkim has its own unique dietary culture with specific cuisine and food recipes. You can get a variety of food in Sikkim, but specialities like the Tibetan Thupka and Momos are very popular here. A beverage to be sampled is the local 'Tchang', a beer made of millet and served in a bamboo mug. You can find this at small restaurants serving Sikkimese cuisine.</p>

<p>Sikkimese are essentially rice-eaters. Alcoholic drinks are popular both amongst men and women. Various traditional fermented foods and beverages is very common. Beef eating is common amongst the Bhutias. Some of the common traditional cuisine with their food recipes are - Momos, Gya Thuk or Thukpa, Ningro with Churpi, Gundruk, Phagshapa, Sael Roti.</p>

<h3><i>Tripuri Cuisine</h3></i>
<p> The large Bengali community in Tripura makes for a non-vegetarian favoured cuisine, with fish being an integral part of the menu. Most of the household here serves authentic Bengali delicacies. Denizens of this state typically don’t cook food with much of a zing to it. But they do like colour on their plate, and use a lot of turmeric. Pork, mithun (a strain of bison) and fish are common sources of meat, but if there’s a particular ingredient that forms the leitmotif of Tripuran cooking, it’s shidal. Used either as a paste or in its dry form, this is made by adding salt and mustard oil to river fish and then keeping it in a clay pot for about a week, until it reaches a certain stage of pungency. Given its strong flavour, shidal is an acquired taste for the non-native. For a native, though, it is a vastly popular flavouring agent and—similar to the use of shrimp paste in the Far East—is even added to a number of vegetarian dishes. A meal isn’t complete without an array of greens. The Reangs, who populate the east of the state, bordering Bangladesh, cook their vegetables in hollow bamboo dishes, over a charcoal fire, much like the Khasis and Garos do in Meghalaya.</p>
